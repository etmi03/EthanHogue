<p>I had surgery on my knees on June 14th, 2017. I had full leg castes for 5 weeks, while I was in the hospital I played on my Nintendo Switch and laptop. I also watched Nintendo's E3 livestream since that was annouced to be right around my surgery time. At E3, they show a lot of trailers and gameplay of upcoming games.
